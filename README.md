This project focuses on the application of dense neural networks to predict the quality of wine. By utilizing various configurations of neural network models, we aim to optimize and evaluate predictive accuracy in determining wine quality.

## Overview

The notebook contains a series of neural network models built and refined to predict wine quality accurately. These models range from simple architectures with a single hidden layer to more complex ones featuring multiple hidden layers and increased neuron counts, demonstrating a systematic approach towards enhancing prediction accuracy.

## Features

- Implementation of neural network models with varying complexity:
  - Model 1: Single hidden layer
  - Model 2: Two hidden layers
  - Model 3: Two hidden layers with increased neuron count
  - Model 4: Four hidden layers with increased neuron count
- Optimization and evaluation of models to achieve high accuracy in wine quality prediction
